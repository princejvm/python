# TIP CALCULATOR

This code is to create a simple calculator that determines the price of a meal after tax and tip.

You've finished eating at a restaurant, and received this bill:

### Cost of meal: $44.50.
### Restaurant tax: 6.75%.
### Tip: 15%.
### You'll apply the tip to the overall cost of the meal (including tax).
